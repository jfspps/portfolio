      <h2>Software portfolio (last edited 17th Aug 2020)</h2>
      <p>
        I have always had a lifelong interest in solving technical problems and initially pursued a career as a research Chemist. Part of my time was spent teaching others, which I found very enjoyable. I then moved into education to gain more experience of teaching Chemistry and develop valuable interpersonal skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I achieved my goals, I decided to explore my other main interest: programming. I have been learning to write (mostly) in Java and feel quite comfortable working to write code for extended periods. The vast majority of my time coding was carried out on a Linux platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am looking for opportunities to work as a professional Java developer and apply my background to the healthcare, science and engineering sectors in the UK. Looking further ahead, I am also interested in gaining experience with other software technologies and languages.

        <h2>Student Record Management</h2>
        <p>Student record management (SRM) is my second Java project and first venture with Spring MVC. In some schools, teachers and support staff still communicate students' results by exchanging spreadsheets. I wanted to couple my teaching experience with software development and design a simple platform, SRM, which enables teaching staff to record and share student results.</p>

        <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms in C/C++, and introduction to MySQL</h2>
        <p>To assist with my own learning of programming, in a language other than Java, I have been following an online course in Data Structures and Algorithms in C and C++. I have also summarised what I have learned from a MySQL course. Writing helped consolidate and motivate my learning, and are also intended to function as personal reference material in the future.</p>
