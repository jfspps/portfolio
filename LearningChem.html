        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <h5>Summary edited 17th Aug 2020</h5>
        <p>
          LearningChem is my effort to pass on what I have learned as an A-level and IBDP chemistry teacher. More relevant to software development, I felt it would be beneficial to learn the basics of web development even though I have no intention of becoming a front-end web developer. The GitHub repository for the demo version is <a href="https://github.com/jfspps/LearningChemDemo">here</a> and the live web application is found <a href="https://www.learningchem.co.uk">here</a>. LearningChem was developed before BodyBand and SRM.
        </p>
        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          LearningChem is built using NodeJS and Bootstrap 4. As with most projects I have built, LearningChem was constructed as I followed an online course. The initial stages of development focused on establishing the basic HTML 5 and CSS 3 framework before quickly moving to Bootstrap 4. The navbar was constructed and stored in the <a href="https://github.com/jfspps/LearningChemDemo/tree/master/views/partials">/partials</a>  directory, along with the header and footer. This reduced the amount of repeated code and simplified the maintenance of the article list. The majority of the figures are SVG files, drawn in Inkscape.

          Central to the function of LearningChem is the controller <a href="https://github.com/jfspps/LearningChemDemo/blob/master/app.js">app.js</a>. All routing is handled using Express. Each article EJS file is identified in an array to reduce the number of get() calls. The following snippet represents an example of something I wrote which was not part of the course.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        app.get("/:someDir", function(req, res){
          //article list ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            const articles = ["1_halfequations","2_DescribingEntropy", "3_OxidationStates", "4_Resonance", "5_HistoryOfElectrons",
            "6_AtomicSpectroscopy", "7_AtomicOrbitals", "8_MixingOrbitals", "9_Hybridisation", "10_CurlyArrows", "11_ElementaryReactions", 
            "12_IdealAndNonIdeal", "13_EnthalpyEntropyChanges", "14_GibbsFreeEnergy"
            ];
          //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            if(articles.includes(req.params.someDir)){
              res.render(req.params.someDir);
            } else res.render("PageNotFound");
          });
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          This produces the list shown opposite.

        <h3>MongoDB</h3>
        <p>
            To gauge how well received LearnChem is, I implemented a MongoDB 4 database to store user comments, questions and contact details. At this stage, I do not intend on vetting submitted comments for future publication. Instead, I respond to users on an individual basis, where appropriate. I did not know SQL at the time and decided to follow the course, utilising MongoDB. LearningChem connects to MongoDB via Mongoose 5. The schema is a collection of string types.
        </p>
        <p>
          To reduce robot activity, I researched and adapted a so-called 'honey-pot' method to verify human activity. Lines 60-62 of <a href="https://github.com/jfspps/LearningChemDemo/blob/master/views/contact.ejs#L60">contact.ejs</a> are hidden tags which set 'humans' to non-null, allowing for the form to be submitted, starting from line 81 in <a href="https://github.com/jfspps/LearningChemDemo/blob/master/app.js#L81">app.js</a>. I was aware of other techniques (captcha's) but wanted to keep the website free of external scripts as much as possible. There are one or two suspect bot messages that get through though nothing excessive.

        Unavailable to readers of LearningChem is, of course, a way to read the feedback (shown opposite). I have two copies of LearningChem on the web server, one which is tasked solely at reviewing feedback. For demonstration purposes, this is reproduced in the <a href="https://github.com/jfspps/LearningChemDemo">LearningChemDemo</a> repository. To view, one must have MongoDB installed and then one use the relative URL '/readFeedback' at the landing page to view the feedback page. Instructions pertaining to login settings are included on the <a href="https://github.com/jfspps/LearningChemDemo">repository's front page</a>. I researched HTTPS certification and currently use Let's Encrypt to secure the feedback form on the live site.

          <h3>Deployment</h3>
          <p>
              Perhaps the biggest, mostly unguided, challenge was finding a suitable web hosting service for the first time. Trying to learn about the technologies which largely have nothing to do with writing code was a bit overwhelming. Finding out how to register domain names and choosing a domain name which addresses the needs of my readers and search engines, and learning about the main differences between virtual private servers and shared web-hosting required some effort. I then read about enterprise level solutions including Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, from 'Cloud Computing Bible' by Barrie Sosinsky. I eventually decided to subscribe to a much simpler VPS solution, and deploy and test LearningChem and future projects with ease. Having root access in Linux and options to deploy on incrementally more powerful VMs was important. Working with CentOS seems to be a sensible choice, given that I hear of many examples of developers using RedHat based platforms. The research into the deployment of the project alone took the best part of 5 days to complete.
